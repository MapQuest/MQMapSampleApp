# MapQuest Maps SDK for iOS


# Welcome

The MapQuestMaps SDK for iOS is a library for embedding highly customized maps within iOS applications. Please visit our [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/maps-sdk/ios/) for instructions on how to get up and running with the SDK.  The Getting Started Guide walks you through the basics of getting a MapQuest API key, setting up maps, and handling the  maps callbacks. Features include:
1. Native Maps
2. Interactive
3. Vector-based Traffic

## How to use this example app

- Open terminal and run `pod update` in the project folder
- Open .xcworkspace from your project folder.
- Add `import MapQuestMaps` in the Swift class, or `@import MapQuestMaps;` in the Objective-C class you want to use MapQuestMaps SDK
- In order to use MapQuest APIs and SDKs you will need a MapQuest Key. We use this key to associate your requests to APIs with your account. You can find your existing Keys or create a new one at 'https://developer.mapquest.com/user/me/apps'.
- Once you have MapQuest Key, add a new row in Info.plist of your project. Set the Key to MQApplicationKey and set the Value to your MapQuest Key.
